# Documentation

Welcome! These docs are written for **users and deployers** of AbstractObserver.
The **source of truth is the code** (not the docs); where relevant we point to the implementing files.

## Start here
1) `getting-started.md` — run the UI and connect to a gateway
2) `faq.md` — common questions and gotchas

## Core concepts
- `architecture.md` — component view + data flow diagrams
- `api.md` — AbstractGateway endpoints used by the UI (grounded in `src/lib/gateway_client.ts`)

## Operate and extend
- `configuration.md` — CLI env vars, UI settings, deployment patterns
- `security.md` — trust boundaries (process manager, remote tool worker, cross-origin)
- `troubleshooting.md` — common issues (CORS, mixed content, stale service worker, blank Gateway URL)
- `development.md` — run from source, tests, build (includes workspace dependency notes)
