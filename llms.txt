# AbstractObserver

> Gateway-only observability UI (Web/PWA) for AbstractFramework runs, served by a tiny Node.js CLI and backed by an AbstractGateway HTTP API.

This repository contains a React single-page app (served from `dist/` by `bin/cli.js`) that connects to an AbstractGateway from the browser.
For exact API paths and request bodies, treat `src/lib/gateway_client.ts` as the source of truth.

## Key files
- [CLI server](bin/cli.js): Static server (`PORT`, `HOST`); optional GPU widget injection
- [Main UI](src/ui/app.tsx): Page routing, settings, gateway interaction
- [Gateway client](src/lib/gateway_client.ts): HTTP client + SSE ledger streaming
- [SSE parser](src/lib/sse_parser.ts): Incremental parser used by `stream_ledger()`
- [MCP worker client](src/lib/mcp_worker_client.ts): JSON-RPC `tools/call` client
- [Vite config](vite.config.ts): Workspace aliases + dev `/api` proxy
- [Package metadata](package.json): Scripts, bin name, Node engine

## Commands
- Run packaged UI server: `npx abstractobserver`
- Dev server (with `/api` proxy): `npm run dev`
- Unit tests: `npm test`
- Production build (writes `dist/`): `npm run build`

## Notes
- Build output lives in `dist/` and is served by `bin/cli.js` (don’t edit `dist/` manually).
- Dev/build uses Vite aliases to sibling workspace packages under `../abstractuic/*/src` (see `vite.config.ts` and `docs/development.md`).
