# Changelog

- (nothing yet)

## 0.1.4 (2026-02-04)
- Docs: refresh documentation for public release (README, getting started, docs index, API contract, FAQ).
- Docs: add security policy (`SECURITY.md`), contributing guide, and acknowledments.
- UI: align theme with AbstractFlow (tokens, typography, inputs/buttons, scrollbars).
- UI: new header with status pills; run picker and ledger cards use clearer labels + relative time.

## 0.1.3 (2026-01-11)
- UI: Digest stays up to date and includes per-subflow stats (polls discovered subrun ledgers).

## 0.1.2 (2026-01-11)
- UI: run picker dropdown is wider and viewport-safe (opens up when needed; never clipped).
- UI: “Existing Runs” shows only parent runs (filters out subruns) and uses the improved run picker.

## 0.1.1 (2026-01-11)
- UI: replace bundle-info block with a single **Start Workflow** primary action (modal-based start).
- UI: simplify Run controls (run picker + refresh; pause/resume; cancel).
- UI: upgrade run picker to a badge-based, aligned list (readable + status color coding).
- UI: move Remote Tool Worker (MCP) settings into the Start Workflow modal (advanced).
- Docs: add `abstractobserver/docs/architecture.md` and link it from the framework architecture overview.
